The wolfSSL examples in the WICED SDK require a server or client application. wolfSSL
provides an easy solution in the <wolfSSL root>/examples/ directory. Run the autogen
script and configure the library with necessary functionality, see ./configure -h for a
list of configure options. Finally, run make and make check to ensure the
build was successfull. You can install wolfSSL on your system with make
install if you wish. See www.wolfssl.com/docs/ for more information.

Run ./examples/server/server -h for a list of server options or
./examples/client/client -h for client options. If you would like
to test the server or client, you may run them on localhost. Instructions on
running the client or server can be found in the snip code examles. The snips are
meant to be a starting off point for your applications.

Download and install WICED Studio from the Cypress website.

In the <wolfSSL_root>/IDE/WICED-STUDIO/ directory, you will find the library file
user_settings.h which should be copied to <wolfSSL_root>. This is your wolfSSL
configuration file. Please see www.wolfssl.com/docs/ for detailed instructions on
how to use the configure options.

Once you have installed the WICED software:
    1. Create a directory called 'wolfssl_lib.' The path should be:
                43xxx_Wi-Fi/WICED/security/BESL/wolfssl_lib.
    3. Drop in the wolfssl_lib directory you just created.
    4. The user_settings.h file in the IDE/WICED-STUDIO/ directory should be place
       at <wolfssl_root>. This file provides the configure options for compiling
       wolfSSL with your project. The default values will give you a starting point
       and you may further configure the library.
    5. Apply the patch:
            git apply --ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace mychanges.patch

You can now build and use the wolfSSL and wolfCrypt snips within the WICED SDK.
Cypress includes great documentation and getting started videos to learn how to
build and run the snips.

wolfSSL provides a wolfCrypt test application, a TLS client and server application,
and an HTTPS client application. Future development and additions will be made.

Support for TLS 1.3 is available in the provided snippet and is the most current
TLS version.
